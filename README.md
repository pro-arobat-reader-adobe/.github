## Your Essential PDF Management Tool

This software is designed as a comprehensive solution for handling, consolidating, and organizing large quantities of documents from multiple sources. It supports a wide variety of file formats and offers numerous practical features, including:

- Managing page order and numbering through thumbnail right-click menus.

- Annotating documents with comments, digital signatures, and editable links.
